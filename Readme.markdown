Introduction
------------

QLMarkdown is a simple QuickLook generator for Markdown files. It renders a
preview of the selected Markdown file using [Discount][Discount] -- a C implementation of
John Gruber's Markdown.pl script.

To update to the latest version of discount run `./discount-config/update-discount.sh`

For more information on Markdown see
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>.


Installation
------------

Simply copy QLMarkdown.qlgenerator to `~/Library/QuickLook` or `/Library/QuickLook`.

If the newly installed plugin is not picked up instantly, you can run `qlmanage -r` in Terminal to refresh.

To uninstall, drag QLMarkdown into the trash.

Another method, provided you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can run the following commands to set things up:

`$ brew update`

`$ brew install qlmarkdown`

To uninstall:

`$ brew uninstall qlmarkdown`


 **Note:** *QuickLook doesn't allow selecting text by default. If you want to select the text in the markdown preview, you will
need to enable text selection in QuickLook by running the following command in Terminal:*

`defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE; killall Finder`

*This command is only valid on OS X 10.10 and below as Apple has since [removed][] the ability to select text in QuickLook.*
